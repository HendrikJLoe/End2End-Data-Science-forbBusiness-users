# End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users


To be able to work with us on the hands-on-lab, please go to the folder [Prerequisites](https://github.ibm.com/Hendrik-Loeffel/End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users/tree/main/Prerequisites) and follow the instructions in the
[pdf file.](https://github.ibm.com/Hendrik-Loeffel/End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users/blob/main/prerequisites/Prerequisites_for_lab.pdf) This step is essential to be able to get the most out of this session. 


Once completed, you can **optionally** revisit and work through the data refinery [tutorial](https://github.ibm.com/Hendrik-Loeffel/End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users/blob/main/DataRefinery/DataRefinery.pdf) located in the folder 
[DataRefinery](https://github.ibm.com/Hendrik-Loeffel/End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users/tree/main/DataRefinery). However, please note that this step is not mandatory, and can also be done in the aftermath of this lab for those of you who 
have a deeper interest in data refinery.

For the hands-on-lab, please download the contents from the lab [folder](https://github.ibm.com/Hendrik-Loeffel/End-to-End-Data-Science-for-Business-Users/tree/main/HandsOnLab) and login to your CP4DAAS environment. This will be the starting point for the lab. 

Thanks in advance, and see you on Thursday!
